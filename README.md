# Solana-Transaction-
A Solana transaction is a signed request sent to the Solana blockchain to perform an action, such as transferring tokens, interacting with smart contracts, or updating an account's data. It is processed in a decentralized manner by validators and, once successfully confirmed, is added to the blockchain ledger.

## Introduction
This guide explains how to perform transactions on the Solana blockchain, including sending SOL, interacting with smart contracts, and confirming transactions.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following:
- Solana CLI installed ([Installation Guide](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools))
- A Solana wallet (such as Phantom, Sollet, or CLI-generated keypair)
- SOL tokens for transaction fees

## Setting Up
### 1. Install Solana CLI
```sh
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
```

### 2. Configure Solana CLI
```sh
solana config set --url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```

### 3. Generate a New Wallet (If Needed)
```sh
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/my-solana-wallet.json
```

### 4. Fund Your Wallet
Send SOL from an exchange or another wallet to your newly created wallet address.
```sh
solana address
```
Use this address to receive SOL.

## Sending a Transaction
To send SOL to another wallet, use the following command:
```sh
solana transfer <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT_SOL> --from ~/my-solana-wallet.json --allow-unfunded-recipient
```
Example:
```sh
solana transfer H3vS...Xyz1 0.1 --from ~/my-solana-wallet.json --allow-unfunded-recipient
```

## Checking Transaction Status
To confirm whether your transaction was successful:
```sh
solana confirm <TRANSACTION_SIGNATURE>
```

## Interacting with Smart Contracts
1. Deploying a smart contract (program):
```sh
solana program deploy <PROGRAM_PATH>
```
2. Invoking a smart contract function:
Use a client SDK (such as Web3.js or Anchor framework) to interact with deployed programs.

## Troubleshooting
- **Not enough SOL?** Add SOL to your wallet via an exchange or faucet.
- **Transaction failed?** Ensure network congestion is low and your wallet has enough SOL for fees.
- **Invalid address?** Double-check that the recipient address is correct.
