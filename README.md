# Solana-Transaction-
A Solana transaction is a signed request sent to the Solana blockchain to perform an action, such as transferring tokens, interacting with smart contracts, or updating an account's data. It is processed in a decentralized manner by validators and, once successfully confirmed, is added to the blockchain ledger.
